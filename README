This is a temporary class providing an easy way to use the powerfull Neo-layout with \XeLaTeX. It does not do very much, but mapping many of the usefull symbols to \TeX\ commands. It is kind of midway between the uniinput package and unicode-math: As stupid as the first one, needing XeTeX as the latter.

neoshorthands is NOT recommended for productive use. It’s more kind of testing things …
